            Where to we begin… Joseph live in Italy and Laura works in UAE. They were introduced by Laura’s brother in law thru online. They started chatting
            eventually became friends and then they decided to meet in the Philippines last Dec 2018 and that’s the beginning of their love story…..

            Long distance relationships are hard, but they’re also incredible! If you can love, trust, respect and support each other from a distance then you’ll be
            unstoppable once you’re physically together.
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s truly amazing how God orchestrated their relationship, it was incredibly unexpected but God makes it perfect. Indeed, God has made everything
            perfect in its time.
